**IMPORTANT** THERE IS ACTUAL CODE IN THIS PAPER. wtf. that's awesome.

# Abstract

*   evolutionary algorithm for network architectures
	*   CIFAR-10 (94.6%)
	*   CIFAR-100 (77.0%)

> Neural networks have proven effective at solving difficult problems but
designing their architectures can be challenging, even for image
classification problems alone. Our goal is to minimize human participation, so
we employ evolutionary algorithms to discover such networks automatically.
Despite significant computational requirements, we show that it is now
possible to evolve models with accuracies within the range of those published
in the last year. Specifi- cally, we employ simple evolutionary techniques at
unprecedented scales to discover models for the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
datasets, starting from trivial initial conditions and reaching accuracies of
94.6% (95.6% for ensemble) and 77.0%, respectively. To do this, we use novel
and intuitive mutation operators that navigate large search spaces; we stress
that no human participation is required once evolution starts and that the
output is a fully-trained model. Throughout this work, we place special
emphasis on the repeatability of results, the variability in the outcomes and
the computational requirements.
