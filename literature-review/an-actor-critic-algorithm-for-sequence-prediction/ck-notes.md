*   they use the actor-critic algorithm from RL to train a supervised learning
	network for machine translations (German-English)

> We present an approach to training neural networks to generate sequences
using actor-critic methods from reinforcement learning (RL). Current log-
likelihood training methods are limited by the discrepancy between their
training and testing modes, as models must generate tokens conditioned on
their previous guesses rather than the ground-truth tokens. We address this
problem by introducing a _critic_ network that is trained to predict the value
of an output token, given the policy of an _actor_ network. This results in a
training procedure that is much closer to the test phase, and allows us to
directly optimize for a task-specific score such as BLEU. Crucially, since we
leverage these techniques in the supervised learning setting rather than the
traditional RL setting, we condition the critic network on the ground-truth
output. We show that our method leads to improved performance on both a
synthetic task, and for German-English machine translation. Our analysis paves
the way for such methods to be applied in natural language generation tasks,
such as machine translation, caption generation, and dialogue modeling.
